Version 0.4.0 (vm_dev branch): (Joel Kuusk, 12.08.2024)
	* changes
		- Use loglevel from config when waiting for instrument to boot
		- fix return of pointer to local variable when throwing ePacketLengthMismatch

Version 0.3.7 (vm_dev branch): (Joel Kuusk, 07.08.2024)
	* changes
		- Improve logging of exceptions
		- Update log messages when waiting for instrument to boot
		- Fix Python 3.12 utcfromtimestamp warnings

Version 0.2:
	* changes:
		- renamed functions and structures to be self-explanatory;
		- driver now does not read calibration coefficients on each instantiation, only when getCalibrationCoefficients() is called. This improves startup time;
		- refactored out direct calls and packet handling from functions. Now low-level serial has single(ish) point of entry;
        - removed boost dependencies;
        - singleton approach for instantiation to avoid serial hardware congestion;
        - added unsafe functions (all the flash write - firmware, calibration)
